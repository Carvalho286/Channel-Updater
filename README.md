# Discord Bot Channel Updater

### Objective

I created this bot with the intention to send an automatic message every day to a chat, or a group of chats, and delete it 10 seconds later.

### How to use

To use this bot, just open the terminal on the folder after downloading in and run the ` npm install ` command to install the necessary libraries for the bot function.
After that just open the code of the ` index.js ` file and do the necessary changes:
1. Change the bot token
   ```
   const token = 'insert_your_token_here';
   ```

2. Change the Channel's IDs
   ```
   const channelIDs = ['channelId_1', 'channelId_2', 'channelId_3', 'channelId_4','channelId_5'];
   ```
   (You're not obligated to use 5 channels, just delete the ones you don't need.)

After everything changed just need to open the terminal again on the folder, and run the ` node . ` command.
On the terminal should just appear something like:
```
Logged in as name_of_the_bot
```
